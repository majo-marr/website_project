		<h1>Portfolio</h1>

		<p>The following are projects where I created and gained valuable skills in digital content creation during the DIG2000 course. </p>
		<p>This includes designing images using Photoshop, producing videos with Premiere Pro, and building a website using HTML.</p>

<div class="section">
		<h5>Photoshop Collage.</h5>
		<img src="media/imaging_project.jpg" height="400">
		<p>In this project I tried to showcase different things that interest me and what were on my mind at the time. The different animals are ones that I have admired more recently and each with their own resoning.</p>
		<p>For example, the jelly fish represents the flow of life and regeneration. The robotic hands represent my interest in robotics. The wording "Can't Decide" was reflecting my thought process  and how undecisive I was. </p>
</div>
		<h5>Stop Motion Video.</h5>
		<video width="480" controls>
			<source src="media/stop_motion.mp4">
			</video>
		<p>I had the  most  fun with this project  because  I got to build a LEGO set to add to my collection. This stop motion was about 256 photos and includes a green screen background. </p>
		<p>I wanted to make the LEGO person seem like a "Master Builder" like from the LEGO movies. I had the idea to tie the LEGO person to a string and have them fly around the car  as if they were building it.</p>
<div  class="section">
		<h5>Premiere Project.</h5>
		<video width="480" controls>
			<source src="media/video.mp4">
		</video>
		<p>I had the hardest time with this project in trying to figure out what I wanted to do. The funny thing about this one was that it was a bit improvised as I went. </p>
		<p>The original script goes a different route after the scene where the woman throws away the LEGO person. I didn't feel like the original script was enjoyable so, I changed and made it up as I filmed.</p>
